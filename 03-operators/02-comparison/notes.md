- <, >, <=, >= are same in both language
- === and !== in js are same as == and != in python

- python
    - `==` to compare values and type of data
    - `is` to compare the memory address of value
   
- js
    - `==` and `!=` to compare only values not type of data
    - `Object.is(value1, value2)` and `sameValueZero(value1, value2)` are also use to compare values
